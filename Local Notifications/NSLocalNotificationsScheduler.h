/*
 The NSLocalNotificationScheduler class is a singleton classes which are an important concept
 to understand because they exhibit an extremely useful design pattern. This idea is used 
 throughout the iPhone SDK, for example, UIApplication has a method called sharedApplication 
 which when called from anywhere will return the UIApplication instance which relates to the 
 currently running application.
 
 Instances of UILocalNotification represent notifications that an application can schedule 
 for presentation to its users at specific dates and times. The operating system is responsible 
 for delivering the notification at the proper time; the application does not have to be running 
 for this to happen. Although local notifications are similar to remote notifications in that 
 they are used for displaying alerts, playing sounds, and badging application icons, they are 
 composed and delivered locally and do not require connection with remote servers.
 
 Local notifications are primarily intended for applications with timer-based behaviors and 
 simple calendar or to-do list applications. Applications that run in the allowed period in the 
 background may also present a local notification, scheduled or immediate, to inform the user 
 of an incoming message, chat, or update. An application can have only a limited number of 
 scheduled notifications; the system keeps the soonest-firing 64 notifications (with 
 automatically rescheduled notifications counting as a single notification) and discards the rest.
 
 When you create a local notification, you must specify when the system should deliver the 
 notification. You can qualify this “fire date” (fireDate) with a time zone so that the 
 fire date is adjusted when time-zone changes occur. You can also specify a repeat 
 interval (daily, weekly, monthly, and so on). The substance of the notification can be an 
 alert message or an application-icon badge number; you can also request that sound be 
 played when alert messages are displayed. Local notifications can include custom data 
 stored in a dictionary. Because UILocalNotification adopts the NSCopying protocol, 
 you can copy existing local notifications and modify them to suit.
 
 The NSLocalNotificationScheduler singleton class gives the ability to schedule local notifications 
 based on a specific fire date, alert text, alert action, sound file, lauch image, user info, 
 and repeat interval.  There is also several helper methods to manage the bagde count per 
 notification, handle a notification when received by operating system, and cancel a specific notification.

 A sharedInstance is often implemented with the singleton pattern. 
 Like in [UIApplication sharedApplication] -> There is only one application which you 
 access through this singleton. The idea is to have one instance of a class which can 
 be accessed by calling a class method, in objective-c commonly named sharedXXX. 
 The sharedInstance class method provides an extremely powerful way to share data 
 between different parts of code without having to pass the data around manually.
